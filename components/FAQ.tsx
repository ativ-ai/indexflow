        <p>
          Our free audit focuses on the foundational on-page elements that search engines care about most:

          <li><strong>Status Code:</strong> Is your page online and accessible?</li>

          <li><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Does it effectively summarize your page for search results?</li>
          <li><strong>H1, H2 & H3 Tags:</strong> Are your headings structured hierarchically to organize content for readers and search engines?</li>
          <li><strong>Robots.txt:</strong> Is the file that guides search engine crawlers present and correctly configured?</li>

    question: "Why is an XML Sitemap important?",
    answerJsx: (
      <p>
        An XML sitemap acts as a roadmap for search engines, listing all the important pages on your website. It helps crawlers like Googlebot find, crawl, and index your content more efficiently, especially for new sites or sites with a complex structure.

    question: "What's included in the generated sitemap?",
    answerJsx: (
      <p>
        The tool generates a standard XML sitemap that includes the URL you entered plus several other plausible internal pages it "discovers" (e.g., /about, /contact, /services). This process also provides you with a list of discovered internal links. You receive a complete, valid sitemap file that you can download, upload to your website's root directory, and submit to search engines.

          This is a PRO feature that uses AI to analyze your website's internal linking structure. A strong internal linking strategy is vital for SEO as it helps search engines understand the relationship between your pages and distributes authority (or "link equity") throughout your site.

    answerJsx: (
        <p>
            The Facebook Pixel is a snippet of code that you place on your website. It allows you to track conversions from Facebook ads, optimize ads, build targeted audiences for future ads, and retarget people who have already taken some kind of action on your website. We check for it as part of our PRO audit because it's a critical tool for any business that uses or plans to use Facebook for marketing.
